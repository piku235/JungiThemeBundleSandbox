            The sandbox contains a simple structure of environments which are used in controllers and two themes.

        <h4>How these environments works?</h4>
        <p>
            The resolved controller decides about an environment for the request - thanks to that a theme resolver knows
            which theme it should use.

        <p>
            The <b>JungiBootstrapThemeBundle</b> acts as a themes container and it provides two simple themes where the
            first one is designed for the <b>default</b> environment and the second one designed for the <b>admin</b>
            environment.
