        <h4>What is included?</h4>
        <p>
            The sandbox contains a simple structure of environments which are used in controllers and two themes.

        <h4>How these environments works?</h4>
        <p>
            The resolved controller decides about an environment for the request - thanks to that a theme resolver knows
            which theme it should use.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <h4>About the themes</h4>
        <p>There're two themes in the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>jungi_bootstrap</b> - designed for the <b>default</b> environment</li>
            <li><b>jungi_bootstrap_admin</b> - designed for the <b>admin</b> environment</li>
        </ul>
